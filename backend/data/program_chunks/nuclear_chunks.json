All eligible applicants will be interviewed. Eligible late applicants will be considered on a space-available basis up to August 1st.\nIf accepted, students must complete the UAB medical history questionnaire and physical, provide proof of required immunizations, and receive satisfactory screening by the UAB Medical Center Student Health Service before enrollment.  A background check and drug screen will be required at program admission and prior to clinical placement.  Persons with a baccalaureate degree may be eligible to register for courses as non-degree seeking graduate students before acceptance into the M.S. program. If a non-degree seeking graduate student meets the M.S. program admission requirements, up to 12 semester hours of approved non-degree graduate coursework may be accepted for the M.S. degree. Admission of a student to any course as a non-degree student does not constitute admission to the M.S. degree program.\nEarly Acceptance\nEarly Acceptance Programs are designed for academically superior high-school students. Early Acceptance Programs allow high achieving students to be admitted to the Master of Science in Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Sciences program at the same time they are admitted to an undergraduate program.\nEligible students are required to maintain a 3.5 undergraduate GPA and complete the following pre-requisite courses: MA 106, CH 105-CH 108 or CH 115-CH 118, BY 216 or NMT 320, BY 115, BY 116, MA 180, PH 201, PH 202, HCM 350, HCM 330, CDS 425\nEssential Functions\nEssential functions are physical abilities, mental abilities, skills, attitudes, and behaviors the students must show evidence of to be able perform at each stage of their didactic and clinical education. A list of essential functions is on file in the NMMIS Program Office and in the NMMIS Student Handbook.\nIf you have a disability, but have not contacted Disability Support Services (DSS), please call (205) 934-4205 (voice) or (205) 934-4248 (TDD), or visit the DSS offices at 1701 9th Avenue South. Additional information is available at\nhttp://www.uab.edu/students/disability/.\nAccreditation and Certification\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Sciences academic programs are accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Nuclear Medicine Technology Programs (JRCNMT). Program graduates are eligible to apply for the certification examination offered by both the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board (NMTCB) or the American Registry of Radiological Technologists (ARRT).\nJRCNMT\n2000 W.
