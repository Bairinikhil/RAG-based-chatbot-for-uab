If you want to combine medical knowledge with engineering expertise in a way that can help improve patient outcomes, consider UAB's PhD in Neuroengineering program.\nYou see, at UAB, we treat thousands of patients each year who have Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, neurological strokes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain tumors, and more. So we know firsthand the difference a program like this can have in the lives of our patients. That's why the School of Engineering and the UAB Heersink School of Medicine have teamed up to develop a curriculum that will prepare you to develop novel therapeutics, neuroprosthetics, and other tools to restore lost brain function and improve patient outcomes. You'll start with a foundation in engineering analysis, signal processing and imaging with neuroscience, neuropathology, and neural dynamics. Then, you'll get to dive into your chosen concentration through a series of advanced elective courses on engineering and neuroscience topics. And when it comes to working on your dissertation, we want your committee to be as interdisciplinary as the field itself. So, you'll get to bring engineers, neuroscientists, and clinicians into your process. Our goal is to prepare you to make a difference in this emerging field—and help patients around the world live better lives.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Directors\nDr. Jamie Tyler\n[wjpt@uab.edu](mailto:wjpt@uab.edu)\nDr. Mark Bolding\n[mbolding@uab.edu](mailto:mbolding@uab.edu)\n# Neuroengineering Ph.D.\nThe Ph.D. in Neuroengineering, a joint program between the UAB School of [Engineering](https://www.uab.edu/engineering) and [Heersink School of Medicine](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/). It is a first-of-its kind program in the state of Alabama and one of the only freestanding neuroengineering doctoral programs in the country.\nThis program integrates advanced topics in such areas as neurophysiology, neural dynamics, neuropathology, systems engineering, computational analysis, advanced imaging, and data analysis. By combining faculty expertise in neurobiology, neuroscience, engineering, and the sciences we are training a new generation of neuroengineers to advance understanding of neurodegenerative disorders and other brain diseases and to develop novel therapeutics, neuroprosthetics, and tools to restore lost brain function and improve patient outcomes.\n## Who Should Apply?\nApplicants should have an undergraduate degree in engineering or a related field with strong computational components. Students with undergraduate degrees in computer science, neuroscience, physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics will also be considered for admission; however, such students must demonstrate preparation for the NE graduate curriculum, including having earned a B or better in Calculus I, Calculus II, and Introduction to Differential Equations. Students who have who lack sufficient mathematical/computational background may be required to take preparatory courses in mathematics prior to being admitted into the program.\nAdmission to the NE Ph.D. program is competitive. Applicants will typically have a GPA of 3.0 or greater from their previous degree(s) (on a 4-point scale) and significant research experience in engineering, neuroscience, or a closely related field.\n## Application and Admission Deadlines\nNeuroengineering students are admitted in the fall semester each year. Applications must be submitted through the Graduate School online application portal.\nApplication fee waivers are given on a first-come, first-served basis to domestic students who meet the minimum admissions requirements and schedule and informational meeting with a co-director.\nPreference for admissions will be given to earlier applicants.\n**Priority Deadline**\nDecember 15, 2025\n**Final Deadline**\nFebruary 1, 2026\n## Application Requirements\n- Minimum 6 months of research experience.\n- International applicants must submit English proficiency scores in accordance with UAB Graduate School requirement. [Click here for details](https://www.uab.edu/graduate/admissions/international-applicants).\n- An online application including all components listed in the [Application Checklist](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/graduate/neuroengineering/checklist).\n- Please upload all documents as PDFs to maintain formatting.\nNOTE:\n- GRE scores are not required\n- there are no specific majors required\n- A master's degree is not required\n[Apply Online](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application)\n## Program Directors\n![Mark Bolding](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/images/images/people/faculty/neuro_bolding25.jpg)\n**Mark Bolding, Ph.D.** **Associate Professor of Radiology, UAB Heersink School of Medicine**\n**Co-Director, Neuroengineering Ph.D. Program** **[mbolding@uab.edu](mailto:mbolding@uab.edu)**\n![William \"Jamie\" Tyler](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/images/images/people/faculty/Jamie%20Tyler.jpg)\n**William \"Jamie\" Tyler, Ph.D.** **Professor, UAB Department of Biomedical Engineering**\n**Co-Director, Neuroengineering Ph.D.** **Program** **[wjpt@uab.edu](mailto:wjpt@uab.edu)**\n\n",
