It is based on an understanding of the structures that control the engineering properties of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Through the development of this understanding, the student learns how to control the properties of materials through various industrial manufacturing processes, how to select the optimum material and predict its behavior under various environmental and service conditions, and how to alter this behavior through materials design, research, and development. Materials Engineers are employed in every major industry, including aerospace, chemical, automotive, energy, defense, metals casting, biomedical, and microelectronics.\n\n",

Students may be exempted from individual courses or examination if they demonstrate that they possess the knowledge from that course, usually with a grade of a B or better. However, the burden of proof is on the student. He/she may accomplish this by passing a prerequisite examination on the portion of the following course content depending on the student's academic background or by one of the two options be.\nThis can be accomplished by one of the methods described below.\nSuccessful completion (minimum grade of B) of\nMSE 280\nEngineering Materials\nMSE 281\nPhysical Materials I\nMSE 380\nThermodynamics of Materials\nMSE 381\nPhysical Materials II\n, and\nMSE 382\nMechanical Behavior of Materials\nSuccessful completion (minimum grade of B) of a prerequisite examination on the content of the courses listed above; or\nSuccessful completion (minimum grade of B) of\nMSE 602\nIntro to Thermodynamics and Mechanics of Materials\nMSE 605\nIntroduction to Physical Materials\nAdditional Requirements\nRequirement\nFulfilled By:\nDeadline for Entry Term(s)\nFall: August 1; Spring: December 1; Summer: May 1\nDeadline for All Application Materials to be in the Graduate School Office\nSeven business days before term begins\nAdditional Academic Policies\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering.
