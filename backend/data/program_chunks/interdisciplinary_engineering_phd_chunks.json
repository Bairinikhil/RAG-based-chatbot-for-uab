You can choose your own path, and we will help design a doctoral program that meets your goals.\nThat’s why this program is a collaboration of five UAB engineering departments and six schools across our campus, with additional partnerships available. And with so many schools and departments available to you, we want to take steps from the beginning to help you build your program. First and foremost, you’ll identify a faculty mentor and dissertation committee that will be instrumental in guiding you as you design your course of study and choose a research topic. Additionally, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary research. Students in this program use their degree to increase their knowledge about the field they already work on or may transition into careers in academia.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[Course CatalogCurriculum & Requirements](http://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/schoolofengineering/interdisciplinaryengineering/?mtm_campaign=DegreePortal&mtm_kwd=interdisciplinary-eng-phd) [Program WebsiteMore About the Program](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/graduate/interdisciplinary-phd)\n## Program Director\nDr. Gregg Janowski\n[janowski@uab.edu](mailto:janowski@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application \"Opens in new tab.\")\n# Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering\n## Today’s professional must constantly change, adapt, focus and navigate among disciplines to keep pace with rapid market shifts and technological advances.\nBecause of these market trends, industries are particularly interested in interdisciplinary graduate education that emphasizes both breadth of knowledge and depth in a particular field. The premise of interdisciplinary programs is that students must be educated in multiple related subject areas to remain competitive and have successful careers in academia or industry. The PhD in Interdisciplinary Engineering Program (IE PhD) provides a rigorous academic curriculum including coursework in two or more disciplines and unique opportunities for interdisciplinary research.\nThe IE PhD program draws upon strengths of the four departments in the UAB School of Engineering: Biomedical Engineering; Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering; and Mechanical and Materials Engineering. Students enrolled in the IE PhD program will gain the skills to succeed as independent and productive investigators in multidisciplinary analysis and design, with applications over a wide spectrum of science, engineering, health, and medical fields.\nThe program provides unique opportunities for interdisciplinary research and fosters interdisciplinary collaborative interactions between students and faculty in the School of Engineering, the Schools of Business, Medicine, and Public Health, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Interdisciplinary engineering students have opportunities to develop a plan of study and a dissertation research topic that incorporates coursework and faculty expertise from two or more disciplines across UAB.\n![\"\"](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/images/photos/research/pelvis-model.jpg)The interdisciplinary program will:\n- Provide a rigorous academic curriculum including coursework in two or more disciplines\n- Provide collaborative interactions with students and faculty from a variety of disciplines\n- Provide unique opportunities for interdisciplinary research\n- Facilitate continued development of high-quality research programs supported by external funding\nThe IE PhD program is not an online program. In many situations it can be completed through distance learning, however, the program cannot guarantee all courses will be available in that format as many of the courses are administered by other programs/schools. Distance learners also need to identify a facility where they can complete their research. Some students have agreements with their places of employment.\nRequest More Info\nForm Settings:\n\n",
