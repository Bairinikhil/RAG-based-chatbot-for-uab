The program stresses critical thinking and is decision oriented, focusing on key aspects of business administration.\nThe MBA program is suitable not only for students with baccalaureate degrees in business but also for those who have degrees in engineering, the sciences, or liberal arts.\nUAB’s MBA program offers an online MBA, and an on-campus program where students may take a combination of face-to-face and online classes. Students may choose to follow either a one or two-year-plan of study to guarantee graduation with a specified time-frame, or to pursue the degree at their own pace. Students have 5 years from term of entry to complete degree requirements.\nConcentrations are available in finance, management information systems, marketing, health services, business analytics and entrepreneurship. Dual Degree options available include MD/MBA, DMD/MBA, OD/MBA, MPH/MBA, MSHA/MBA, MSN/MBA, ASEM/MBA, and several additional Engineering/MBA programs. Applicants interested in these dual degree options are required to apply and be accepted to both degree programs.\nQuantitative Requirement\nApplicants should be quantitatively proficient with the ability to analyze and interpret numerical information. All entering students must prove competency in fundamental mathematical operations by passing a proficiency quiz upon admission to the program. For students who need a refresher before taking the quiz, study materials will be available via an online platform. Study materials and quiz are provided at no cost.\nMore information about this can be found on the\nCollat School of Business website\nGrade Point Average Policy\nThe MBA program follows the\nGPA policy\nset forth by the Graduate School.\nAdmission\nTo obtain specific admissions requirements on how to apply to Graduate School, prospective students should visit this page:\nhttps://www.uab.edu/business/home/admissions/graduate/mba\nApplication Deadlines\nFall semester - July 1st\nSpring semester  - November 1st\nSummer semester- April 1st\n*It is suggested that international applicants should apply at least 6 months in advance of the deadline to ensure processing of all Visa paperwork.\nThere is no international admission in summer term.\nRequired Documents\nApplication form\nincluding 3 letters of reference\nCurrent resume\nOfficial transcripts from all colleges and universities attended sent directly by the Registrar to the UAB Graduate School, 1720 2nd Ave. S., LHL G03, Birmingham, AL 35294-0013, or electronically to gradschool@uab.edu.\nGMAT score* (optional) Students may submit a GMAT score of 500 or greater to increase their chance of acceptance.\nKira Talent Assessment (online interviewing platform)\nAdditional Documents Required for International Applicants\nTOEFL IBT score of 80 with a minimum score of 20 in each section or IELTS of 6.5 with a minimum score of 6.0 in each section or a composite score of 140 on the Duolingo with a minimum of 120 required in all skill areas (international applicants only)\nTranscript Evaluations\nApplicants with coursework earned from institutions outside the United States must provide a course-by-course foreign college transcript evaluation of all attended non-U.S. institutions.* We will accept a transcript evaluation from any NACES accredited evaluation company.

Non-degree seeking students are limited to applying 12 hours credit earned in this status to a degree-seeking program, if admitted. The option to enter as non-degree seeking will be offered to candidates who miss the application deadline for applying to the MBA program, but who submit all materials prior to the beginning of the term and meet admission requirements, provided that there are seats available. We will require a resume, copies of transcripts, and GMAT scores along with the application.

If a student is enrolled in courses offered in a 7-week format, those credit hours are applied toward the 9 semester hour requirement for the entire 14-week term.\nExample: If a student is enrolled in 6 credit hours in the Spring A term (first 7 weeks) and 3 credit hours in the Spring B term (second 7 weeks), the university recognizes this student to be enrolled in 9 semester hours for the entire period (14-week term), and of full time status.\nAccelerated Bachelor's to Master's Program (ABM)\nExceptional students currently enrolled in an undergraduate degree program at UAB may apply to our Accelerated Bachelor’s/Master’s program (ABM). This program is open to all students who meet the criteria for admission, regardless of their major.\nHow the MBA ABM Program Works\nTo accelerate progress through a master’s degree in the Masters of Business Administration, a limited number of graduate courses (up to 12 credit hours) may be counted towards both the completion of the undergraduate degree and the MBA graduate degree. While concurrent completion of both degrees is possible, it is often not the case. Students who satisfy requirements for the undergraduate degree before completion of 12 hours of MBA coursework must file for undergraduate graduation and then proceed in the MBA program as a degree-seeking graduate students paying graduate tuition.\nFor non-business majors, these 12 hours of MBA coursework may count as elective credit towards completion of the undergraduate degree. For business majors, approved MBA classes and their corresponding undergraduate courses approved for sharing credit are listed at the end of this section.\nAdmissions\nThe Accelerated Bachelors/Master’s Program is for exceptional students. The accepted students will have:\nA minimum GPA of 3.7 in all institutional courses\nA minimum of 60 credit hours (45 of these credits must have been taken at UAB). ).

This plan must be agreed upon by all parties (student, their undergraduate academic advisor, undergraduate program director, graduate program advisor, and graduate program director) and strictly adhered to while in the MBA ABM program for continued participation.\nInterested students must apply well in advance of the application deadline and should meet with their financial aid/scholarship advisor to determine the impact of ABM on their scholarships and/or aid award.\nNext, students must submit the MBA ABM program application including ABM form, application fee, essay, resume, and one recommendation.\nAdmission is by a committee chaired by the graduate program director, consisting of the graduate program director\nand the graduate program advisor.\nCredit Sharing Policy\nTo accelerate progress through the MBA degree, a limited number of courses (up to 12 credit hours) may be counted as an elective towards the completion of the bachelor’s degree and toward the completion of the MBA degree.\nThe selected MBA courses must be approved by the student’s undergraduate academic advisor, undergraduate program director, graduate program advisor, and graduate program director as part of the ABM form.\nLimited to a total of 12 credit hours of coursework\nMaintaining Status in MBA ABM\nTo maintain status in the ABM, the student must:\nmaintain a 3.25 average in undergraduate courses\nreceive a grade of B or better in the MBA classes taken while still an undergraduate student\nmaintain fulltime student status at UAB\nIf any of these requirements is violated, the student will be withdrawn from the ABM program.
