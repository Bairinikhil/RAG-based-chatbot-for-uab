Our dual degree offers a balanced course schedule and reduced total credit hour requirement so both degrees can be pursued at the same time. Students can apply two MEng electives toward the MBA requirements, leaving 10 courses in the MBA program. All MEng courses are online and the MBA courses are presented in a blended on-campus/online format.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n### Blended\nThis program delivers at least half of the content online with the remaining content delivered via on-\ncampus meetings. Please check with the program director for more information about on-campus\nrequirements.\n[## Program Director\nBrandon Cox, Graduate Recruiter\n[bcc@uab.edu](mailto: bcc@uab.edu)\n[Collat School of Business](https://www.uab.edu/business/home)\n[Apply](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/admissions)\nVisit\n[Contact](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/about/contact-us)\n[Give](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/about/give)\n- [In This Section](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba/dual-degrees/meng-mba#)\n- [Master of Business Administration](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba)\n  - [MBA Dual Degrees](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba/dual-degrees)\n  - [MBA Admissions](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/admissions/graduate/mba)\n  - [Associated Faculty](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba/associated-faculty)\n  - [Contact](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba/contact)\n  - Related\n  - [Tuition & Fees](https://www.uab.edu/cost-aid/)\n  - [Scholarships](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/scholarships)\n  - [Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's Program](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/abm)\n# MEng / MBA Program\n![A female faculty member instructing a female student in an engineering lab. ](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/images/photos/inline/mba/MENG-MBA-inline-800x640px.jpg)\nUAB's Collat School of Business and [School of Engineering opens a new website](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/) partner to empower students to combine the analytical and technical skills taught in the Master of Engineering program (MEng) with critical skills needed to lead teams, manage projects, and solve business problems. Students can concurrently pursue a MEng and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree with a balanced course schedule and reduced total credit hour requirement through our MEng/MBA Dual Degree.\n## Why an MBA?\nWhile engineering professionals often possess analytical capability that is highly valued in the business world, they often lack the business skills to leverage this capability. Leaders need to synthesize diverse information and repackage it so that people can understand it. Management requires the ability to connect with others, collaborate on projects, and influence your co-workers to meet organizational goals. Those interested in management or starting their own companies need to be able to tackle larger and more abstract strategic problems such as project management, budgets, forecasting, cost estimation, and proposal development.\n## Program Specifics\nIn this dual degree program, students can apply two courses from the MEng program as electives towards the MBA program requirements. This leaves MEng/MBA students with ten courses to take in the MBA program. All MEng courses are taught online. MBA courses can be taken online or in the classroom, meeting once a week in the evenings.\nStudents select from the following MEng specialized concentrations: Construction Engineering Management, Information Engineering Management, Sustainable Smart Cities, Structural Engineering, and Advanced Safety Engineering Management.
