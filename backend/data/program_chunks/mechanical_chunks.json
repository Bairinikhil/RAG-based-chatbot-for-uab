However, such a student will normally have to take additional, preparatory coursework as part of an expanded plan of study (see \"Preparatory Courses\" later in this section).\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering. No more than 6 combined hours of Special Topics and/or Independent Study courses will be applied to the degree without appeal to and approval from the Program Director.\nThe School of Engineering offers similar courses at the 400/500 and 600/700 levels. While the higher numbered course has more advanced content, there is a significant overlap in topics. Therefore, students are not allowed to take a 500-level or 700-level course for credit if they have previously taken the related 400-level or 600-level course, respectively.\nUAB offers Accelerated Bachelor’s / Master’s and Early Acceptance. To learn more about these programs, including requirements and how to apply, visit the\nGraduate School’s ALO page\nAccelerated Bachelor's / Master's\nAccelerated Bachelor's / Master's\nMechanical Engineering offers an accelerated Bachelor's / Master's (ABM) option for high-achieving undergraduate students pursuing a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering at UAB. Once enrolled in the program, students may take up to 12 credit hours of 500-level Mechanical Engineering graduate courses for shared credit. A successful graduate of ABM will earn both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in ME from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in an accelerated time-frame compared to the independent completion of the two degrees.\nPlan I (Thesis Option)\nUpon admission to the program, the Graduate Program Director will advise the student on courses for the first semester. During the first semester, the student will be assigned a Committee Chair, based on research interest, who will assist the student in forming their graduate study committee. The committee will consist of the Chair and two graduate faculty members with experience or expertise related to the student's thesis topic. The Chair, in coordination with the committee, will aid the student in course selection.\nIn addition to the general Graduate School requirements, the student must successfully complete at least 24 semester hours of coursework, including:\n6 semester hours in committee-approved mathematics courses\n18 semester hours in committee-approved mechanical engineering courses or approved related courses, including at least 2 semester hours of\nMME 601\nMechanical and Materials Engineering Seminar\nand 3 semester hours in a course outside the student’s research or specialization area.\nA student is eligible for admission to candidacy after (1) a written thesis has been orally presented to and approved by the committee and (2) successful completion of\nResponsible Conduct in Research\ntraining.\nAfter admission to candidacy, the student must register for at least 6 hours of\nME 699\nThesis Research in addition to the 24 semester hours of coursework.\nThe student must successfully complete and defend a thesis.\nPlan II (Non-thesis Option)\nGenerally, Plan II will be approved for students working full-time and attending UAB on a part-time basis or when the student demonstrates that Plan II offers superior educational benefits. After 15 credit hours of coursework are completed, the student should select a project director and begin work on the final project. The election of Plan II must be approved by the student's graduate advisor.\nThe student must successfully complete at least 33 semester hours of coursework, including:\n6 semester hours in approved mathematics courses\nA minimum of 27 semester hours in approved mechanical engineering courses or approved related courses.  Of these 27 semester hours, students must enroll in:\nat least 3 semester hours in a course outside the student’s research or specialization area\nat least 2 semester hours of\nMME 601\nMechanical and Materials Engineering Seminar\nat least 3 hours of\nME 698\nNon-Thesis Research involving design or research\nThe student must make a presentation on the research project and submit a final report which must be approved by the project director.\nEarly Acceptance\nEarly Acceptance Programs are designed for academically superior high school students. Early Acceptance Programs allow high-achieving students to be conditionally admitted into a graduate program at the same time they are admitted to an undergraduate program.\nEligible students are required to maintain a 3.50 undergraduate GPA and complete the following prerequisite courses: ME 241, ME 321, ME 364, and ME 371.\nPreparatory Courses\nThe following courses and their prerequisites are required preparation for the graduate program in mechanical engineering. Students will be required to successfully complete the courses below or present equivalent prior coursework. Additional courses may be required depending on the research interest.\nRequirements\nHours\nME 241\nThermodynamics I\nME 321\nIntroduction to Fluid Mechanics\nME 322\nIntroduction to Heat Transfer\nME 360\nIntroduction to Mechatronic Systems Engineering\nME 370\nKinematics and Dynamics of Machinery\nME 371\nMachine Design\nCE 220\nMechanics of Solids\n\n",
