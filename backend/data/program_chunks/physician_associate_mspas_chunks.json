Tosi Gilford\n[tgilford@uab.edu](mailto:tgilford@uab.edu)\n## About the Program\nAs a physician associate, you're caring for and treating patients, making diagnoses, and even prescribing medications. Simply put, your judgment is critical in providing quality health care for your community. We can give you the knowledge you need to assist doctors and treat your own patients in acute-care, surgical, and medical settings.\nTo get started, you'll take courses like Human Gross Anatomy, Medical Physiology, and Clinical Pathology. You will also take medical and surgical courses such as Clinical Medicine, Surgical Disease, Pharmacology, Clinical Laboratory Medicine, History and Physical Examination, Electrocardiography, and Simulated Concepts. Once you have completed your didactic studies, you will complete a clinical year which consists of seven core rotations and four elective rotations. Because we want to get you as prepared for your career as possible, we also offer professional development classes that focus on the interpersonal competencies required to deliver compassionate healthcare in clinical practice. Finally, completion of literature analysis, research courses, and your final research project will give you the experience needed to pursue higher education or other future scholarly opportunities. When you become a certified physician associate, you will be licensed to practice medicine under the direct supervision of a licensed physician.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. M.

It is the second oldest PA program in the nation and was established only two years after the birth of the PA profession. The UAB PA program is **ranked No. 21 in the 2025 _U.S. News & World Report_ \" [Best Physician Assistant Programs](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/physician-assistant-rankings)\" rankings**, placing it in the top five percent of PA programs across the nation.\nThe program provides intense didactic and clinical experiences in primary care, medicine, and surgery. It is one of few programs that offers both a cadaveric dissection experience to supplement anatomy, and a live pig lab to provide a practical, hands-on experience to strengthen the surgical component of the curriculum.\nThe PA program and UAB are dedicated to excellence in teaching, research, scholarship, and community service. Students have an opportunity to study within the UAB Hospital system, noted to be one of the top medical centers in the U.S. Our students have opportunities to complete clinical rotations in emergency medicine, primary care, surgery, behavioral medicine, trauma, critical care, and women’s health, at clinical sites located within and surrounding the Birmingham area. Graduates of our 27-month program earn a Master of Science in Physician Associate Studies (MSPAS) degree upon completion of the program.\nView information about the [coordinated Master of Science in Physician Associate Studies and Master in Public Health (MSPAS/MPH)](https://www.uab.edu/shp/cds/physician-assistant-studies/mspas-mph) dual degree program.\nView our [NCCPA PANCE Performance Summary Report](https://www.uab.edu/shp/cds/images/documents/physician-assistant-studies/UAB-PA-Goals-Outcomes-2024.pdf) and [Student Attrition Table](https://www.uab.edu/shp/cds/images/documents/physician-assistant-studies/PA_Student_Attrition_Chart_2024.png) for the program.\nFor more information about the Physician Associate Studies program, call us at 205-975-4237 or email us at [AskCDS@uab.edu](mailto:AskCDS@uab.edu).\n# Program Accreditation\nThe [Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA)](http://www.arc-pa.org/) has granted **Accreditation-Continued status** to the **University of Alabama at Birmingham, Physician Associate Studies Program** sponsored by the **University of Alabama at Birmingham**. Accreditation-Continued is an accreditation status granted when a currently accredited program is in compliance with the ARC-PA _Standards_.\nAccreditation remains in effect until the program closes or withdraws from the accreditation process or until accreditation is withdrawn for failure to comply with the _Standards_. The approximate date for the next validation review of the program by the ARC-PA will be **March 2034**. The review date is contingent upon continued compliance with the Accreditation Standards and ARC-PA policy.\nThe program’s accreditation history can be viewed on the ARC-PA website at [http://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-university-of-alabama-at-birmingham/](http://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-university-of-alabama-at-birmingham/).\n# Professional Licensure and Certifications\nThe UAB Physician Associate Studies Program is designed to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that will prepare them for professional certification through the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). While there is a national certification exam that is offered by NCCPA, board certification does not confer state licensure. Specific licensure requirements vary by state.
