But to do this, they need trained experts to make sure both the patients and the providers stay safe. We can give you that high-level expertise to work with radionuclides and become a qualified entry-level technologist.\nTo say that we've been around the block is a gross understatement. Fact is, we were the first nuclear medicine technology program in the U.S. to rise to a master's entry-level status. And we remain the only one in Alabama. Our expert staff can provide you with a solid background through both didactic and clinical curriculums. You'll receive instruction about topics such as medical radiation physics, radiation detection instrumentation, pharmacology, anatomy, and physiology, among others. Your directed clinical practice will give you much-needed experience in radiopharmacy, in vivo procedures, instrumentation quality control, and applied radiation safety procedures. We'll also teach you to operate the premier molecular imaging tool that physicians use to diagnose, stage, and treat disease. Finally, to prepare you better for the real world, we're going to give you professional development courses, plus research opportunities. This program can help you prepare for certification exams offered through the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board.\n### Concentrations\nImaging Specialist Track\nRadiation Safety Track\nResearch Track\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Amy Brady\n[amyglass@uab.edu](mailto:amyglass@uab.edu)\n### Program Accreditation\n![jrcnmt accreditation seal](https://www.uab.edu/shp/cds/images/images/graduate/nuclear-medicine-technology/jrcnmt-accreditation-seal.jpeg)\nThe NMMIS program is accredited by the [Joint Review Committee on Educational Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology](https://www.jrcnmt.org/)(JRCNMT).
