Erwin, MD, DrPH\nAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs:\nGreg Pavela, PhD, MA\nWebsite:\nwww.uab.edu/soph\nPrimary Email:\nsoph@uab.edu\nAbout the School of Public Health\nSchools of public health were established to develop leaders and scientists who could bring academic rigor to the discipline of \"assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.\" Once the major challenges related to sanitation and clean water, vaccine-preventable diseases, and other communicable diseases were identified (although never fully solved!), public health as an academic discipline began to examine the larger issues of where and how we live, work, and play, and the influence these have on whether families, communities, and populations can live healthy lives.\nThe great challenges before us now are understanding the root causes — known as social determinants of health — that shape our capacity as individuals, families, communities, and populations to become and remain healthy. The COVID-19 pandemic unmasked the effects of these social determinants of health and their role in creating health inequities. We are just beginning to grasp how these determinants impact, and are impacted by, our environment, which in turn affects gene expression and individual susceptibilities to both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Connecting this understanding to the impacts of climate change on human health is a commitment the school is making through a new school-level faculty hiring initiative.\nOur school engages with local leaders in Birmingham to address homicide as a public health crisis, supports community efforts to address the decades-long environmental injustices related to environmental contamination in north Birmingham, works with communities in the Black Belt of rural Alabama to understand the disparities in the development of hypertension, and develops novel methods of stemming the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, public health leaders from our school have provided expert guidance to the University of Alabama System and UAB regarding COVID-19 related policies and procedures; we have been engaged in regular consultations with the Jefferson County Health Department in Birmingham, as well as with the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH); and we have supported the work of ADPH through our school’s Case Investigation/Contact Tracing activities, the establishment of a Regional Center for Infection Prevention and Control, and our management of COVID-19 testing in K-12 schools across the state.\nOpportunities abound for students to explore connections between public health and other academic disciplines across the UAB campus. We offer practical and meaningful internship experiences through partnerships with state and local governmental agencies, local businesses and industry, and a global network of governmental and non-governmental organizations. Students have been at the forefront of our COVID-19 activities, most notably becoming Contact Tracers – simultaneously learning public health and DOING public health! Students in the UAB School of Public Health have life-changing opportunities to BE SOMEBODY and MAKE A DIFFERENCE! Come join us!\nAdmission Requirements\nOur graduate programs in Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Behavior, and Health Policy and Organization offer students intellectual tools to address complex problems with a global perspective. Whether you are looking for a highly rated program that provides the opportunity to work next to leading researchers or you are a graduate student looking for information related to your studies, we have everything you need. Click the applicable link below for information related to your particular need.\nIf you are applying to a stand-alone MPH, MSPH, or DrPH program, you will submit your primary application via\nsophas.org\n.  All students admitted through SOPHAS must also complete a supplemental application, and pay the application fee, to the UAB Graduate School. If admitted, you will then complete a supplemental application to the UAB Graduate School. Instructions will be provided upon admission. The cost for a\nSOPHAS application\nis $150 for the first school or program to which you apply. Any additional schools or programs to which you choose to apply will cost $60 per designation, even if you submit those schools or programs later in the application cycle.\nIf you are applying to any of our coordinated degree programs, Certificates, the MS in Biostatistics, an accelerated Master’s program (offered to current UAB undergraduate students only), or the PhD programs, submit your application via the\nUAB Graduate School\n. The UAB Graduate School’s standard fee is $50 for domestic applicants and $60 for international applicants.\nSee our\nwebsite\nfor further information on program availability, where to apply, and when to apply.\nStill have questions? Send an email to\nsoph@uab.edu\nor contact us by phone at (205) 934-4993.\nAccelerated Learning Opportunities\nPublic Health offers both\nFast-Track and Accelerated Bachelor's/Masters (ABM)\noptions for high-achieving undergraduate students.\nFast Track Master of Public Health Program\nallows motivated undergraduate students to begin coursework for a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree while still completing their undergraduate degree requirements. We welcome students from any major to consider the Fast Track MPH program and will provide academic advising to assist students in planning their graduate coursework, which students can begin once they have completed 60 undergraduate credit hours (including 36 at UAB).\nEligibility\nUAB students in any major are eligible to apply for this program; there are no course prerequisites for admission. The GRE is not required for admission to our MPH program.\nTo be considered for the Fast Track Program, students must have:\nCompleted between 60 and 90 hours of undergraduate coursework.\nA minimum institutional GPA of 3.25.\nAn application completed through the UAB Graduate School website (SOPHAS application is not required for Fast Track applicants).\nAn official copy of the current UAB undergraduate transcript.\nTwo letters of recommendation: one from a current academic advisor and one from current or previous college course instructor. Electronic submission is preferred; however, referees can mail a letter in a sealed envelope directly to the UAB Graduate School.\nA career statement describing interests and goals in Public Health.\nA one-page CV/resume of academic activities including awards and community service.\nAccelerated Bachelor's to Master of Public Health Program\nallows motivated undergraduate students to begin coursework for a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree while still completing their undergraduate degree requirements. We welcome students from any major to consider the ABM program and will provide academic advising to assist students in planning their graduate coursework, which students can begin once they have completed 60 undergraduate credit hours (including 36 at UAB). As a major benefit of this program, up to 12 hours of graduate credit can be counted toward (shared) with the undergraduate degree, saving students time and money.\nEligibility\nUAB students in any major are eligible to apply for this program; there are no course prerequisites for admission.
