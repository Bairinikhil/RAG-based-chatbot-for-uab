To determine academic eligibility for admissions, academic credentials must be:\n· Translated to English;\n· Evaluated course-by-course;\n· Include the overall academic GPA; and\n· From an approved third party company. We will accept a transcript evaluation from any NACES accredited evaluation company.\nSpanTran\nSpanTran created a custom UAB application that will ensure you select the right kind of evaluation at a discounted rate. You can access their application through the\nSpanTran application – The University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nInternational Student and Scholar Services will have access to your decision and a representative will contact you directly if any other documentation is necessary to begin processing your immigration documents.\n*UAB will complete the evaluation for institutions outside of the United States if they are on a 4.0 grading scale. UAB reserves the right to request a NACES-accredited evaluation if a determination is made that the evaluation cannot be completed internally.\nFull Time Student Enrollment Status\nTo be enrolled as a full-time graduate student, a student must register for at least 9 semester hours in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.\nhttp://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/enrollment/\n. If a student is enrolled in courses offered in a 7-week format, those credit hours are applied toward the 9 semester hour requirement for the entire 14-week term.\nExample: If a student is enrolled in 6 credit hours in the Spring A term (first 7 weeks) and 3 credit hours in the Spring B term (second 7 weeks), the university recognizes this student to be enrolled in 9 semester hours for the entire period (14-week term), and of full time status.\nAccelerated Bachelor's/Master's Program (ABM)\nA successful graduate of the ABM will earn a bachelor's degree and Master of Accounting degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Collat School of Business in an accelerated time period compared to the independent completion of these two degrees. Students will graduate with a bachelor's degree upon completing the requirements for the Master of Accounting.\nAdmissions\nThe Accelerated Bachelors/Master's Program is for exceptional students. The accepted student will have:\nAn average GPA of 3.5 in all institutional courses\nA minimum of 60 credit hours (36 of these credit hours must have been taken at UAB).\nStudents admitted to UAB as transfer students are eligible to apply after earning 60 or more undergraduate hours, at least 24 of which must be earned at UAB.\nBefore applying, the student must meet with their graduate program coordinator and their undergraduate advisor to discuss program requirements; students should also meet with a financial aid/scholarship advisor to determine the impact of ABM on their scholarships and/or aid award. The student should also be advised that additional credit hours may be required for licensure as a CPA.\nUpon acceptance, a detailed plan of study must be mapped out specific to each ABM student. This plan must be agreed upon by the student, their undergraduate academic advisor, and graduate program coordinator and strictly adhered to while in the ABM program to guarantee their continued participation in the ABM.\nAcceptance into the program takes place after a student has earned 60 credit hours of coursework. Admission is by a committee chaired by the graduate program director, consisting of the graduate program director and department program coordinator.\nTo maintain status in ABM, the student must:​\nmaintain an institutional GPA of 3.25 or higher\nreceive a B (or higher) in all courses taken while still an undergraduate student\nmaintain full time student status at UAB\nAccounting and Finance Department will waive the hour requirement for internship terms if the internship causes them to drop below the full time student hour requirement.\nIf these requirements are violated, the student will be withdrawn from the ABM program. If a student is withdrawn from the ABM program, they will retain credit for the courses already completed in the program.\nOnce the student has completed all undergraduate course requirements for graduation, their undergraduate degree will be awarded. Once the student graduates from a bachelor's degree program, they enter the Master of Accounting program and must maintain the requirements of that program. Tuition is then charged at the graduate rate.\nTo accelerate progress through the Master of Accounting degree, a limited number of courses (up to 12 credit hours) may be counted toward completing the bachelor's degree and completing the Master of Accounting degree. The student's undergraduate academic advisor must approve the selected Master of Accounting courses.\nGraduate courses allowed for credit sharing are the following:\nAC 523\nExternal Auditing\nAC 530\nIntermediate Accounting III\nLS 557\nBusiness Law for Accountants\nAC 573\nFraud Examination\nAC 580\nCorporate Financial Reporting and Analysis\nAC 600\nAccounting Research\nEarly Acceptance Program\nEarly Acceptance Programs are designed for academically superior high-school students. Early Acceptance Programs allow high achieving students to be admitted to the Master of Accounting (M.Ac.) program while they are admitted to an undergraduate program.\nEligible students are required to maintain a 3.5 undergraduate GPA and complete the following pre-requisite courses:\nBUS 202\nAC 300\nAC 304\nAC 309\nAC 310\nAC 401\nAC 402\nAC 423\n, and\nAC 430\nUniform CPA Examination\nEligibility requirements for sitting for the Uniform CPA examination vary among the states and territories.  For detailed information about these requirements, please contact the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) at\nhttps://nasba.org/stateboards/\n. The state of Alabama, through its Accountancy Laws and the Alabama State Board of Public Accountancy (ASBPA),\nwww.asbpa.alabama.gov/\n), requires that applicants for the Uniform CPA Examination hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and possess a total of 120 semester hours of postsecondary education, including at least 24 semester hours of accounting in specified areas at the upper-division or graduate level and 24 semester hours in business-related courses. The UAB\n120-hour\nundergraduate accounting program does not provide all the classes needed for a 150-hour CPA licensure in Alabama.  The UAB\n120-hour\nundergraduate accounting program\noffers all\nclasses\nrequired\nto sit\nfor the CPA exam in Alabama.\nOther Professional Accounting Certifications\nOther examinations leading to professional certification (CMA, CIA, CFE, CISA, etc.) generally do not require academic course work beyond the baccalaureate degree. Students interested in other accounting certifications should contact any accounting faculty member for further information.\n\n",
