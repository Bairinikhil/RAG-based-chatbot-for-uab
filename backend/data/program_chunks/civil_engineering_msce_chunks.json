At UAB, we can give you the engineering, design, and planning background you need to be a leader in civil engineering.\nTo prepare you for your career, we've designed a program that you can tailor based on your interests and goals. We have four concentrations for you to choose from, including construction engineering management, in which you can learn about cost and revenue estimating, risk, and more. You can also specialize in construction engineering management to learn about cost and revenue estimating, risk, and more. Plus you can choose a thesis option, non-thesis option with an emphasis on research and design, or a non-thesis option with an emphasis on sustainable engineering design. But no matter which you choose, you're going to need to both complete a comprehensive exam and defend either your research project or thesis in order to graduate. Finally, we're going to offer you the opportunity to earn a certificate in environmental, structural, sustainable, and transportation engineering, or engineering construction management. In the end, you'll have the best chance at an education designed to meet your specific career goals.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Nasim Uddin\n[nuddin@uab.edu](mailto:nuddin@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application \"Opens in new tab.\")\n# Master of Science in Civil Engineering\n![\"\"](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/civil/images/images/academics/metal-bars.jpg)A master of science in civil engineering equips engineers to advance in various industrial or academic career fields that emphasize high-level and collaborative research. An M.S. in civil engineering can serve as a step toward a Ph.D. in engineering, or it can provide the experience and credentials needed to increase competiveness in the job market. The program can be completed in as few as two years, though the typical student takes two courses per term for five semesters.\n## Admission\nIn addition to the [UAB Graduate School admission requirements](https://www.uab.edu/graduate/admissions), requirements for admission to the program leading to the Master of Science in Civil Engineering degree include the following criteria:\n1. An undergraduate engineering degree from an ABET accredited program. Applicants who do not meet this criterion but who have an outstanding academic record in an engineering degree program not accredited by ABET, or in a baccalaureate degree program in a related field, may be admitted on probation. Students admitted in this category will be required to complete a sequence of undergraduate courses in addition to the normal requirements of the M.S. in Civil Engineering. This set of extra requirements will be specified in writing at the time of admission to the program.\n2. GPA of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale in all undergraduate degree major courses attempted.\n3. Three letters of evaluation concerning the applicant's previous academic and professional work.\n4. A minimum score of 80 on the TOEFL or a 6.5 on the IELTS is required for international applicants whose native language is not English.\n5. Verification of registration by examination as a Professional Engineer (P.E.) will satisfy criteria 4 above.\nCompleted applications are reviewed by the Civil Engineering graduate program committee.\n[Download the Graduate School Application Process Checklist (pdf)](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/civil/images/documents/graduate/CE-GRADUATE_SCHOOL_APPLICAITON_PROCESS_CHECKLIST.pdf)\n## Requirements\nProgram requirements and course descriptions can be found in the [UAB Graduate Catalog](http://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/schoolofengineering/civilconstructionandenvironmental/#mscetext \"Opens in new tab.\"). MSCE students choose between a thesis (Plan I) and a non-thesis (Plan II) track. Thesis students will research, write, and defend a master's thesis. Non-thesis students will complete non-thesis research and pass a comprehensive examination.\n## Specializations\nThe department offers specialization programs in the fields of:\n- structural engineering/structural mechanics,\n- environmental engineering,\n- transportation engineering, and\n- construction engineering management.\nSupporting courses are offered in geotechnical engineering, optimization, engineering law, and other areas. Information about these concentrations are also found in the Graduate Catalog.\n## Questions?\nFor more information on the master's program, contact Nasim Uddin, Ph.D., Professor and director of the graduate program, at (205) 934-8432 or [nuddin@uab.edu](mailto:nuddin@uab.edu).\n[Apply Now](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application \"Opens in new tab.\")\n\n",
