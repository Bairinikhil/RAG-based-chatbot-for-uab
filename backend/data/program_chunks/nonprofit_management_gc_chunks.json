We can teach you the skills you need to help run your organization more effectively and efficiently.\nYou see, we know working in nonprofits is demanding, so we carefully designed our program to teach you the cutting-edge skills, best practices, and essential management tools that are important in nonprofit management. Your required coursework will include marketing and fundraising, as well as nonprofit management. Depending on your specific career goals, we have a variety of elective options for you to choose from, subjects such as grant writing and management, economic development, strategic planning, and more. Best of all, when you earn your certificate, you can apply up to four courses toward our Master of Public Administration program as long as you've earned at least B in each of them. And because many of our students have day jobs, you can take classes on campus or online.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Erin Borry\n[borry@uab.edu](mailto:borry@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application \"Opens in new tab.\")\n[Apply Now](https://cloud.reach.uab.edu/graduate-application \"Opens in new tab.\")\n# Nonprofit Management\n![4 PSPA inline h 800x640px](https://www.uab.edu/cas/pspa/images/photos/inline/4-PSPA-inline-h-800x640px.jpg)The Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management provides practitioners in the Greater Birmingham area with an opportunity to enhance their skills and improve their capacity to effectively run their organizations. This program is designed to serve those who wish to gain specialized knowledge in the field of nonprofit management without committing to a full graduate program.\nThis Certificate is earned after completion of five (5) courses totaling 15 credit hours. For the most up-to-date information about courses, please visit the [Graduate Catalog](http://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/collegeofartsciences/politicalscienceandpublicadministration/#certificatestext).

A maximum of four (4) courses (12 hours) with a grade of B or better may be applied toward the MPA degree if the student is accepted in the program.\nSuccessful completion of the Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management does not automatically admit a student into the MPA program.

Students who pursue the MPA degree following certification must complete all course work within five years of the first course taken in the certificate program.\nIf you have any questions about the graduate certificate in Nonprofit Management, contact Carin Mayo at [ccmayo@uab.edu](mailto:ccmayo@uab.edu).\n\n",
