The profession was established in 1965 to help physicians provide healthcare services to under-served and rural populations. While the profession remains committed to its historical mission, PAs are now employed in almost all medical and surgical specialties.\nPAs are healthcare professionals licensed to practice medicine under the supervision of a physician.  Individual state practice laws and hospital bylaws define the scope of practice and prescribing authority of physician associates. To be eligible for licensure, PAs must graduate from an accredited physician assistant program and pass the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE). To maintain licensure, PAs must complete 100 hours of continuing medical education credits every two years and pass the Physician Assistant National Recertification Examination (PANRE) every ten years. PAs may obtain additional training through postgraduate residency programs in various subspecialty areas, but these programs are not required for licensure or practice in subspecialty areas.\nAdmission Prerequisite Coursework and Application Information\nAll prerequisite courses must be successfully completed in the United States.\nRequirements\nHours\nBY 115\nHuman Anatomy\nBY 116\nIntroductory Human Physiology\nBY 409\nPrinciples of Human Physiology\nBY 123\nIntroductory Biology I\nBY 124\nIntroductory Biology II\nBY 261\nIntroduction to Microbiology\nBY 271\nBiology of Microorganisms\nCH 115\nCH 116\nCH 117\nCH 118\nGeneral Chemistry I\nand General Chemistry I Laboratory\nand General Chemistry II\nand General Chemistry II Laboratory\n(CH 105, CH 106, CH 107, CH 108 accepted)\nPY 216\nElementary Statistical Methods\nand Elementary Statistical Methods Laboratory\nMA 180\nIntroduction to Statistics\nHCM 360\nStatistics for Managers\nPY 101\nIntroduction to Psychology\nPY 201\nHonors Introduction to Psychology\nPY 212\nDevelopmental Psychology\nPY 218\nPsychopathology\nMedical Terminology\nHCM 350\nMedical Terminology for Health Professionals\nGrad Additional Info\nDeadline for All Application  Materials to be received by the  CASPA:\nCompleted applications must be received by the Central  Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) no later  than August 1 the year prior to the expected term of  enrollment\nNumber of Evaluations/Letters of Recommendation Required:\nThree\nEntrance Tests:\nGRE (TOEFL is required for international applicants whose  native language is not English).\nAccreditation\nThe Physician Assistant Studies Program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc.
