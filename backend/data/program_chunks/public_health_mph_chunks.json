Each degree program provides a broad overview of [foundational public health knowledge](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/foundational-knowledge). Throughout each degree program, students work to develop appropriate mastery of the competencies or skills that public health professionals and leaders use every day to protect and promote the health of communities.\nThough students are introduced to common research methods in public health through these degree programs (including biostatistics, epidemiology, and qualitative methods), those seeking careers in research-intensive or academic settings should consider a [research-based degree](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based).\n- [Master of Public Health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based)\n- [Doctor of Public Health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based)\n- The **MPH** is the most well-known Public Health degree. It is considered a “terminal” or “professional” degree, as it fully prepares individuals for lifelong careers in public health practice without the need for additional education. This is in contrast to the [Master of Science in Public Health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based) (MSPH), a research-oriented degree ideal for individuals planning to work in academic settings or pursue doctoral-level training.\nAt UAB, all MPH degree programs begin with a shared [MPH Core](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/mph-core-curriculum) based on the Evidence-Based Public Health framework, which provides all students with the [practice-based skills](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/mph-foundational-competencies) they need to be effective in the public health workforce. Students further enhance their training through one of many departmental concentrations; these concentrations are designed to deepen students’ knowledge in specific areas of public health. Regardless of concentration, all MPH students engage in an [Applied Practice Experience](https://www.soph.uab.edu/fieldplacements/) (Internship) in the community and conclude their coursework with an Integrative Learning Experience (Capstone) in which they pull together skills and perspectives learned in both the Core and the concentration courses to produce a high-quality written product, demonstrating their readiness to enter the workforce.\nCommon career settings for individuals holding the MPH degree include state and local health departments; community-based organizations and non-profits; healthcare consulting firms; international, state, and federal agencies (e.g., WHO, CMS, CDC); managed care organizations; and various clinical settings. Because of the broad training in public health management included in the MPH degree, individuals often pursue the degree when looking to advance into leadership roles in these settings.\n[MPH Foundational Competencies](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/mph-foundational-competencies)\n[MPH Core Curriculum](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/mph-core-curriculum)\n- Like the MPH, the **DrPH** is an applied degree that focuses on the profession and practice of public health. The DrPH is designed for individuals intending to become leaders and innovators in their chosen concentration. The curriculum focuses on building [strong skills](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/drph-foundational-competencies) in data and analysis; leadership, management, and governance; policy and programs; and education and workforce development through both didactic and co-curricular experiential learning opportunities. Students then pursue additional advanced coursework and/or independent study in their focal area.\nAll DrPH students engage in an intensive Applied Practice Experience (practicum) and sit for comprehensive exams to demonstrate their mastery of their focal area. Students prepare and defend a practice-oriented dissertation which illustrates their ability to propose, conduct, and synthesize independent research to transform public health practice.\n[DrPH

health professional from their peers in the public health sector. The Certified in Public Health (CPH) credential is administered by the National Board of Public Health Examiners ( [www.nbphe.org](http://www.nbphe.org/)). Specific licensure requirements vary from state to state, and among territories. Please visit the [Professional Licensure and Certification General Disclosures webpage](https://www.uab.edu/elearning/students/professional-licensure) for more information on state and territories requirements.\n\n",
