With our coordinated Public Health/Business Administration degree, you can be prepared for a non-profit or government career, entrepreneurship, or any of a broad range of professions.\nOur MPH/MBA program is offered in conjunction with the UAB Collat School of Business. Your MPH will give you a solid foundation in public health centered around an evidence-based public health model. MPH courses, which you can take online, will share up to 12 credit hours of the MBA program, so you can finish your degree in a timely manner. You’ll also have the opportunity to focus additional training in areas such as healthcare organization, health behavior and program development, health policy, and many other areas of public health.\n### Concentrations\nThis program offers a concentration in Population Health and is administered through the Office of Student and Academic Services at the UAB School of Public Health.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n### Online Definition\nThe MPH portion of this program can be taken online.\n[## Program Director\nMeghan Walker\n[mewalker@uab.edu](mailto:mewalker@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/apply/graduate) [Contact](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/about/contact-us)\n# MPH/MBA\nFormat: Online, In-Class\nThe coordinated [Public Health/Business Administration (MBA) degree program](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/programs/graduate-degrees/mba/dual-degrees/mph-mba) is offered through the UAB School of Public Health (SOPH) and the [UAB Collat School of Business](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/). Earning these two advanced degrees prepares students for a broad range of careers in health care management, entrepreneurship, and leadership.\nStudents in this coordinated program earn an MPH with a concentration in Population Health. In this individualized concentration, students gain a solid foundation in public health through completion of the [MPH core](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based/mph-core-curriculum) (based on the Evidence-based Public Health framework), an Applied Practice Experience (Internship), and an Integrative Learning Experience (Capstone). Students also select from among all master’s-level Public Health courses (e.g., health economics, strategic planning, health policy) to build a unique curriculum that supports their career goals. Specialized advising is provided to assist students in designing their individualized curriculum.\n## Curriculum\nStudents may complete the MPH portion of this coordinated degree program totally online, in class, or through a mix of online and in-class experiences.\nA total of 60 credit hours of coursework are required for the coordinated MPH/MBA. Normally, 42 credit hours are required for the MPH; however, because of the coordinated nature of the degree 12 credit hours from the MBA curriculum are credited to the MPH. This allows students to earn both degrees in reduced time and at reduced cost.\nOnline students pay less than the out-of-state tuition rate for the MPH portion of this coordinated degree.\n[Download Sample Curriculum Planning Sheet (pdf)](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/images/documents/sample-plans/2025-2026/MBA-MPH-Curriculum-Planning-Sheet.pdf)\n## Admission\n**Students must apply separately to each program.**\n- [Learn how to apply to the School of Public Health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/apply/graduate).

I already have a doctoral degree in clinical psychology, but in my current position, I help with the development of educational programs to service 320 clinics nationally and have a need for business foundations and skills. While many schools have remote education opportunities, not every institution accommodates their students the way that UAB does. The infrastructure of the coordinated degree programs really creates an opportunity for those in the middle of their professional career to evaluate whether continuing education is best for them. For a student like me, who has aspirations of integrating public health leadership and business with clinical practice, the MPH/MBA coordinated degree program has really added value to my career.\n\\- Dr. John Ross (MPH/MBA ‘26)\n## Contact\nFor additional information concerning the coordinated MPH/MBA program, contact the School of Public Health at [soph@uab.edu](mailto:soph@uab.edu).\n\n",
