UAB is a top-25 institution for NIH funding, and BME graduate students have many opportunities to conduct cutting-edge multidisciplinary research. BME researchers enjoy collaborations across UAB’s very active medical and dental schools as well as with researchers across the United States and beyond.\nThe BME Department offers Master of Science and PhD degrees. Students enrolled in UAB’s MD/PhD or DMD/PhD programs may receive the PhD portion of their training in the Biomedical Engineering department. Students in any BME graduate program who are interested in the commercialization of biomedical technology are encouraged to complete the 15-hour Graduate Certificate in Translations of Biomedical Innovations to Clinical Practice Certificate offered by BME.\nAdmitted PhD students begin Fall term while MSBME students may be admitted for Fall or Spring. For full consideration, applications should be submitted by the priority deadline of January 15. Applications submitted as late as the UAB Graduate School’s Fall deadline may be considered depending on the availability of positions.\nInternational applicants must submit English proficiency scores in accordance with UAB Graduate School requirement.

      "chunk_text": "# Biomedical Engineering Bsbme\n\n## Admission Requirements\n\nStudents entering the MSBME program normally have earned a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, another engineering discipline, or a closely-related field. Students with undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics will also be considered for admission; however, such students must demonstrate preparation for the BME graduate curriculum.\nAdmission to the MS program is competitive. Successful applicants typically have an undergraduate GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4-point scale). However, applications are reviewed holistically and applicants with lower grades may be admitted based on factors such as strong research or professional experience. Scores on the GRE General Test are not required but are accepted.\nUAB offers Accelerated Bachelor’s / Master’s and Early Acceptance. To learn more about these programs, including requirements and how to apply, visit the\nGraduate School’s ALO page\nAccelerated Bachelor-Master's Program in Biomedical Engineering\nBiomedical Engineering offers an accelerated Bachelor's / Master's (ABM) option for high-achieving undergraduate students pursuing a BS degree in Biomedical Engineering at UAB. A successful graduate of ABM will earn both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in BME from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in an accelerated time-frame compared to completing the two degrees independently.\nTo be considered for the ABM program, students must:\nHave a UAB GPA of at least 3.5\nHave earned 60 or more undergraduate credit hours (36 of which must have been completed at UAB)\nHave junior-level standing and have completed at least 2 of the required junior-level BME courses\nApply to the program through the normal UAB Graduate School application portal.\nApplicants are expected to have already selected a research mentor for their graduate studies, typically continuing their undergraduate research. One of the letters of recommendation must come from the research mentor\nHighlights of the ABM program:\nStudents may pursue either the Plan I or Plan II MSBME option.\nOnce enrolled in the program, students may take up to 12 credit hours of 500-level BME graduate courses that will count towards the MSBME degree.\nAdditional Academic Policies\nStudents must maintain an overall GPA of 3.00 to remain in good academic standing in the BME Graduate Program.\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering. No more than 6 combined hours of Special Topics and/or Independent Study courses will be applied to the MSBME without appeal to and approval from the Program Director.\nThe School of Engineering offers similar courses at the 400/500 and 600/700 levels. While the higher numbered course has more advanced content, there is a significant overlap in topics. Therefore, students are not allowed to take a 500-level or 700-level course for credit if they have previously taken the related 400-level or 600-level course, respectively.\nMSBME Plan I (Thesis Option)\nThe Plan I Master’s degree requires completion of at least 30 semester hours of graduate work.\nA Graduate Study Committee consisting of at least three faculty members should be formed. At least one committee member must have a primary  appointment within BME and one must have a primary appointment outside of BME. A student is eligible for admission to candidacy after (1) a written thesis proposal has been orally presented to the committee and approved and (2) completion of\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR)\ntraining. Admission to candidacy must take place at least one semester before the student may graduate. A written thesis embodying the results of the student’s original research must then be publicly defended, approved by the committee, and submitted to the Graduate School.\nUpon completing a Plan I MSBME degree, a student may petition to continue their graduate training in the BME PhD program. This does not require a new application to the UAB Graduate School.\nMaster of Science in Biomedical Engineering\nMSBME Plan I (Thesis Option) - 30 hours\nRequirements\nHours\nBME 617\nEngineering Analysis\nBME 655\nNextGen BioMed-Research Technologies and Skills (Can be taken in place of BME 617)\nME 661\nMath Methods in EGR I (Can be taken in place of BME 617)\nBME 670\nQuantitative Physiology\nBST 621\nStatistical Methods I\nBME Elective 500-697\nLife Science Elective at the 500+ level\nBME/EGR/Math/Life Science Elective at the 500+ level\nBME 601\nSeminar in Biomedical Engineering (Must be taken three times)\nBME 601\nSeminar in Biomedical Engineering\nBME 601\nSeminar in Biomedical Engineering\nBME 698\nNon-Thesis Research\nBME 699\nThesis Research\nTotal Hours\nStudents in the Graduate Certificate in Technology Commercialization and Entrepreneurship program are encouraged to choose\nBMEM 601\nOne hour of\nBME 697\nmay substitute for one hour of\nBME 601\nAn additional 3 hour BME/EGR/Science Elective at the 500+ level may substitute\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training plus in-person workshop must be completed before admission to candidacy\nCourse taken after admission to candidacy\nMSBME Plan II (Non-Thesis Option) - 30 hours\nThe Plan II Master’s degree requires completion of at least 30 semester hours of graduate-level work.

Students with undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics will also be considered for admission; however, such students must demonstrate preparation for the BME graduate curriculum.\nAdmission to the BME PhD program is competitive. Successful applicants have a 3.5 or greater GPA from their previous degree(s) (on a 4-point scale) and significant research experience. Scores on the GRE General Test are not required but are accepted.\nStudents admitted to the doctoral program typically receive a competitive stipend that includes payment of tuition.\nIn addition to completing coursework requirements (see below), doctoral students must form a Graduate Dissertation Committee consisting of at least five faculty members, including the primary research mentor. At least one committee member must have a primary BME appointment and two must have a primary appointment outside of BME. A written dissertation proposal must be orally presented to the committee and approved, at which time the student is admitted to candidacy. This must take place at least two semesters before the student may graduate. A written dissertation embodying the results of the student’s original research must then be publicly defended, approved by the committee, and submitted to the Graduate School.\nPublication Requirement. Original peer-reviewed research articles in reputable journals are the standard for demonstrating scientific productivity. The research conducted by BME doctoral students is expected to result in such publications. Before the degree is awarded, students are required to have at least one “first-author” journal article that has been published (or accepted for publication) and a second that has been submitted to a journal. Many students will be co-authors on collaborative research articles and may also share authorship on review articles, book chapters, conference proceedings, and other forms of scientific communication. Although these works bolster the student’s scientific credentials, they do not count toward the BME publication requirement. In some cases, first-authorship of an article is shared among multiple individuals. In these cases, the article may count toward the publication requirement of only one BME doctoral student.\nAdditional Academic Policies\nStudents must maintain an overall GPA of 3.00 to remain in good academic standing in the BME Graduate Program.\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering. No more than 6 combined hours of Special Topics and/or Independent Study courses will be applied to the PhD without appeal to and approval from the Program Director.\nThe School of Engineering offers similar courses at the 400/500 and 600/700 levels.
