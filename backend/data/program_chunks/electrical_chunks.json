The MSECE program builds upon the broad foundation provided by a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering by supplying depth in specific electrical and computer engineering areas through advanced coursework and a thesis or project experience.\nAdmission Requirements\nRequirements for admission to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Master's degree program include the following:\nA bachelor's degree in an accredited electrical engineering, computer engineering, electrical and computer engineering or a bachelor's degree acceptable to the graduate faculty in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Students not having a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, electrical and computer engineering may be required to complete prerequisite courses based on their prior coursework and their plan of study, which will be defined at the time of admission.\nA 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale;\nThree letters of recommendation concerning the applicant's previous academic and professional work;\nInternational applicants must submit English proficiency scores in accordance with UAB Graduate School requirement.\nClick here for details\nOriginal transcripts from all colleges and universities attended since high school must be sent directly to the UAB Graduate School (detailed instructions are included during the online application process)\nUAB offers Accelerated Bachelor’s / Master’s and Early Acceptance. To learn more about these programs, including requirements and how to apply, visit the\nGraduate School’s ALO page\nFast Track Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering\nUAB Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate students with significant research experience may begin work toward their MSECE degree while still undergraduates. To be considered for this program, students must have junior-level standing (more than 60 hours completed), have completed at least 3 of the required junior-level ECE courses, and have a UAB GPA of at least 3.5. Applicants are expected to have already selected a research mentor for their graduate studies, which will typically be a continuation of their undergraduate research. Application to the program is through the normal UAB Graduate School application portal. One of the letters of recommendation must be from the research mentor. Once enrolled in the program, before completing their undergraduate degree, students may take graduate courses that will be applied to the MSECE degree. Note that coursework may not be applied toward both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Students may pursue either the Plan I or Plan II MSECE option.\nAccelerated Bachelor's / Master's\nElectrical and Computer Engineering offers an accelerated Bachelor's / Master's (ABM) option for high-achieving undergraduate students pursuing a BS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UAB. The following courses are approved for shared credit for students pursuing an ABM in ECE. A successful graduate of ABM will earn both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in ECE from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in an accelerated timeframe compared to the independent completion of the two degrees.\nGraduate courses allowed for credit sharing are:\nEE 512\nEE 518\nEE 523\nEE 526\nEE 527\nEE 531\nEE 532\nEE 533\nEE 534\nEE 537\nEE 538\nEE 544\nEE 547\nEE 548\nEE 552\nEE 558\nEE 561\nEE 571\nEE 572\nEE 573\nEE 585\nEE 634\nEE 654\nEE 655\nEE 656\nEE 658\nPlan I (Thesis Option)\nThe Plan I Master's degree requires completion of at least 33 credit hours of graduate work.\n18 credit hours of graduate-level courses appropriate to the student's area of technical specialization\n6 credit hours of courses having a mathematical emphasis\n9 credit hours of\nEE 699\nThesis Research\nStudents must be admitted to candidacy prior to enrolling in EE 699. A student is eligible for admission to candidacy after (1) a written thesis proposal has been orally presented to the committee and approved and (2) completion of\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR)\ntraining. Admission to candidacy must take place at least one semester before the student may graduate.\nPlan II (Non-Thesis Option)\nThe Plan II Master's degree requires completion of at least 33 semester hours of graduate work.\n24 credit hours of graduate-level courses appropriate to the student's area of technical  and professional specialization;\n6 credit hours of courses having a mathematical emphasis;\n3 credit hours of\nEE 697\nGraduate Project\nAdditional Academic Policies\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering. No more than 6 combined credit hours of Special Topics and/or Independent Study courses will be applied to the degree without appeal to and approval from the Program Director.\nThe School of Engineering offers similar courses at the 400/500 and 600/700 levels. While the higher numbered course has more advanced content, there is a significant overlap in topics. Therefore, students are not allowed to take a 500-level or 700-level course for credit if they have previously taken the related 400-level or 600-level course, respectively.\n\n",
