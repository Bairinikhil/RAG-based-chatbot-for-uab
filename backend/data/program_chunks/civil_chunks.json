Continuous enrollment for at least 3 credit hours per semester is required. Students receiving a research assistantship are required to be enrolled as full-time students. A full-time student is one who is enrolled in at least 9 credit hours per semester.\nSpecial Topics (590/690/790) courses and Independent Study (591/691/791) courses are reviewed for degree applicability for each program in the School of Engineering. No more than 6 combined credit hours of Special Topics and/or Independent Study courses will be applied to the MSCE degree without appeal to and approval from the Program Director.\nThe SOE offers similar courses at the 400/500 and 600/700 levels. While the higher numbered course has more advanced content, there is a significant overlap in topics. Therefore, students are not allowed to take a 500-level or 700-elevel course for credit if they have previously taken the related 400-level or 600 level course, respectively.\nWhen the graduate student successfully completes required coursework, the student opted for Plan I (Thesis Option) should apply to enter candidacy. Once a master’s candidate, the student must complete a minimum of 9 credit hours of thesis research (\nCE 699\n) over the course of at least two semesters. Prior to admission of candidacy, the student can take research credit hours in the form of non-thesis research credit hours (\nCE 698\n). These non-thesis research credit hours cannot be converted from non-thesis research credits into thesis research credits.\nMSCE/MPH Curriculum\nRequirements\nHours\nMPH Core Requirements\nPUH 601\nThis is Public Health\nPUH 602\nCommunity Assessment\nPUH 603\nQuantitative Methods in Public Health\nPUH 604\nPrograms and Policies\nPUH 605\nPublic Health Management and Evaluation\nPUH 606\nLeadership for Evidence-Based Public Health\nMPH Degree Requirement\nENH 690\nEnvironmental Health Perspectives\nPopulation Health Requirement\nPUH 610\nPopulation Health\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Recommended Courses\nENH 600\nFundamentals of Environmental Health Science\nENH 612\nAssessing & Managing Environmental Risks\nENH 660\nFundamentals of Air and Water Pollution\nMPH Applied Practice Experience\nPUH 688\nPublic Health Internship\nMPH Integrative Learning Experience\nENH 689\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Integrative Learning Experience\nTotal Hours Earned for MPH Degree: 30\nMPH Shared Hours from MSCE Curriculum\nCE 580\nIntroduction to Water and Wastewater Treatment\nCE 585\nEngineering Hydrology\nCE 530\nWater Supply/Drainage Design\nCE 608\nGreen Building Design\nTotal Hours Earned for MPH Degree\nRemaining MSCE Program Requirements\nCE 531\nEnergy Resources\nCE 537\nEnvironmental Experimental Design and Field Sampling\nCE 731\nEnvironmental Law\nCE 699\nThesis Research\nTotal Unique MSCE Hours: 30\nMSCE Shared Hours from MPH Curriculum\nENH 612\nAssessing & Managing Environmental Risks\nTotal Hours Earned for MSCE Degree\nTotal Hours Completed for MSCE/MPH Degree\nStudents may substitute ENH courses to meet their educational objectives with consent of advisor (7 credit hours minimum required)\nMeets UAB Graduate School requirements of a minimum 30 hours of graduate work\nMeets the CEPH MPH requirements of a minimum of 42 semester hours\nCourse substitutions may be made with consent of advisor\nEHS faculty will serve on thesis committee\nFor Thesis students; Non-Thesis students will register for a total of 6 credit hours of CE electives and 3 credit hours of CE 698 Non-Thesis Research\nMaster of Science in Engineering\nAssumes the recommended Environmental Health Sciences courses plus PUH 610 Population Health (12 credit hours)\n\n",

Earning these two advanced degrees provides students with a foundation for positions in research, government, as well as private industry. Students in this coordinated program earn a Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering (PhD). The PhD program is intended for students who have achieved high levels of scholarship and are capable of conducting independent and original research. PhD students in civil engineering will work closely with faculty in the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, but they may also work on interdisciplinary teams with faculty from other UAB departments as well as outside industry. The program offers a broad curriculum covering engineering designs, resilient and sustainable urban development, low carbon and renewable energy systems, green infrastructure, natural resource management, health and livability, transport and mobility, big data analytics, and smart technologies. In addition to the PhD, students earn a Master of Public Health (MPH) with a concentration in Population Health. In this concentration, students gain a solid foundation in public health through completion of the MPH core (based on the Evidence-based Public Health framework), an Applied Practice Experience (Internship), and an Integrative Learning Experience (Capstone). Students also complete environmental health sciences courses focusing on urban health issues including air and water pollution, occupational safety, and assessing and managing environmental risks. Graduates of this coordinated degree program will conduct research in and create solutions for human habitats that are safe, clean, and sustainable addressing issues such as the growing stressors of energy security, population growth and health, food supply, waste disposal, climate change, and future infrastructure demands.\nIn addition to the UAB Graduate School admission requirements, requirements for admission to the program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering degree include the following five criteria:\nAn undergraduate engineering degree from an ABET accredited program or a master’s degree in engineering. Applicants who do not meet this criterion but who have an outstanding academic record in an engineering degree program not accredited by ABET, or in a baccalaureate or master’s degree program in a related field, may be admitted on probation. Students admitted in this category will be required to complete a sequence of undergraduate or graduate courses in addition to the regular requirements of the MSCE degree. This set of extra requirements will be specified in writing at the time of admission to the program.\nAn undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale in all undergraduate degree major courses attempted. Individuals not meeting this requirement but who have a strong professional background and excellent references may be admitted.;\nThree (3) letters of evaluation concerning the applicant's previous academic and professional work; and\nNo GRE required.\nInternational students are required to have a bachelor's or master’s degree in engineering or a science related field and must submit TOEFL, IELTS, PTEA, IELA, or Duolingo scores.   (https://www.uab.edu/graduate/admissions/international-applicants#english-proficiency-exams).  Duolingo scores are preferred by the UAB Graduate School.\nVerification of registration by examination as a Professional Engineer (P.E.) will satisfy criterion 2 above.\nDoctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering and Master of Public Health with a concentration in Population Health\nTwo curricula have been developed for this coordinated program, one for students entering with a Master’s of Science in Civil Engineering (MSCE) or closely related field and another for students entering without an MSCE, most likely with on a baccalaureate degree in Civil Engineering or closely-related field. The curriculum planning grid and a breakdown of coursework by degree program is attached for both options are attached. For students entering with an MSCE degree, a total of 81-83 credit hours of coursework are required for the coordinated PhD/MPH Normally, 42-44 credit hours are required for the MPH; however, because of the coordinated nature of the degree 12 credit hours from the PhD curriculum are credited to the MPH This allows students to earn both degrees in reduced time and at reduced cost. The PhD program 27 credit hours of coursework beyond the master’s degree, plus a minimum of 24 credit hours of dissertation research. For students entering without an MSCE degree, a total of 90-92 credit hours of coursework are required for the coordinated PhD/MPH Normally, 42-44 credit hours are required for the MPH; however, because of the coordinated nature of the degree 12 credit hours from the PhD curriculum are credited to the MPH Twelve credit hours from the MPH degree are used to meet PhD program requirements. This allows students to earn both degrees in reduced time and at reduced cost. The PhD program requires 48 credit hours of coursework beyond the master’s degree, plus a minimum of 24 credit hours of dissertation research. Students may complete the MPH portion of this coordinated degree program totally online, in class or through a mix of online and in-class experiences. Online students pay less than the out-of-state tuition rate for the MPH portion of this coordinated degree.\nCurriculum for students entering with an acceptable bachelor's degree\nRequirements\nHours\nMPH Core Requirements\nPUH 601\nThis is Public Health\nPUH 602\nCommunity Assessment\nPUH 603\nQuantitative Methods in Public Health\nPUH 604\nPrograms and Policies\nPUH 605\nPublic Health Management and Evaluation\nPUH 606\nLeadership for Evidence-Based Public Health\nMPH Degree Requirement\nENH 690\nEnvironmental Health Perspectives\nPopulation Health Degree Requirement\nPUH 610\nPopulation Health\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Recommended Courses\nENH 600\nFundamentals of Environmental Health Science\nENH 612\nAssessing & Managing Environmental Risks\nENH 660\nFundamentals of Air and Water Pollution\nMPH Applied Practice Experience\nPUH 688\nPublic Health Internship\nMPH Integrative Learning Experience\nENH 689\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Integrative Learning Experience\nTotal Unique SOPH Hours: minimum 30 required\nShared Hours from PhD in Civil Engineering\nCE 530\nWater Supply/Drainage Design\nCE 580\nIntroduction to Water and Wastewater Treatment\nCE 608\nGreen Building Design\nCE 685\nEngineering Hydrology\nCE 608\nGreen Building Design\nCE 685\nEngineering Hydrology\nTotal Hours Earned for MPH Degree: 42 hours\nRemaining Hours from PhD in Civil Engineering Program Requirements\nCE 740\nWastewater Treatment Engineering\nCE 786\nEngineering Hydrogeology\nCE 787\nStormwater Detention Pond Design\nGRD 717\nPrinciples of Scientific Integrity\nCE 799\nDissertation Research\nCE Electives\nTotal Hours Earned for PhD in Civil Engineering: 72 Hours\nTotal Hours Completed for PhD in Civil Engineering/MPH Degree\nStudent may substitute ENH courses to meet their educational objectives with consent of advisor (7 credit hours minimum required)\nMeets UAB Graduate School requirements of a minimum 30 hours of graduate work\nMeets the CEPH MPH requirements of a minimum of 42 semester hours\nCourse substitutions may be made with consent of advisor; Assumes the recommended Environmental Health Sciences courses plus PUH 610 Population Health (12 credit hours); A minimum of 72 total credit hours are required, 48 hours of coursework and 24 hours of dissertation research\nA minimum of 24 credit hours, taken over at least 2 terms, are required\nCurriculum for students entering with an acceptable Master's degree\nRequirements\nHours\nMPH Core Requirements\nPUH 601\nThis is Public Health\nPUH 602\nCommunity Assessment\nPUH 603\nQuantitative Methods in Public Health\nPUH 604\nPrograms and Policies\nPUH 605\nPublic Health Management and Evaluation\nPUH 606\nLeadership for Evidence-Based Public Health\nMPH Degree Requirement\nENH 690\nEnvironmental Health Perspectives\nPopulation Health Degree Requirement\nPUH 610\nPopulation Health\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Recommended Courses\nENH 600\nFundamentals of Environmental Health Science\nENH 612\nAssessing & Managing Environmental Risks\nENH 660\nFundamentals of Air and Water Pollution\nMPH Applied Practice Experience\nPUH 688\nPublic Health Internship\nMPH Integrative Learning Experience\nENH 689\nEnvironmental Health Sciences Integrative Learning Experience\nTotal Unique SOPH Hours: minimum 30 required\nShared Hours from PhD in Civil Engineering\nCE 530\nWater Supply/Drainage Design\nCE 580\nIntroduction to Water and Wastewater Treatment\nCE 608\nGreen Building Design\nCE 685\nEngineering Hydrology\nTotal Hours Earned for MPH Degree: 42 hours\nRemaining Hours from PhD in Civil Engineering Program Requirements\nCE 740\nWastewater Treatment Engineering\nCE 786\nEngineering Hydrogeology\nCE 787\nStormwater Detention Pond Design\nGRD 717\nPrinciples of Scientific Integrity\nCE 799\nDissertation Research\nCE Electives\nTotal Hours Earned for PhD in Civil Engineering: 72 Hours\nTotal Hours Completed for PhD in Civil Engineering/MPH Degree\nStudent may substitute ENH courses to meet their educational objectives with consent of advisor (7 credit hours minimum required)\nMeets UAB Graduate School requirements of a minimum 30 hours of graduate work\nMeets the CEPH MPH requirements of a minimum of 42 semester hours\nCourse substitutions may be made with consent of advisor\nA minimum of 24 credit hours, taken over at least 2 terms, are required\nAssumes the recommended Environmental Health Sciences courses plus PUH 610 Population Health (12 credit hours); A minimum of 72 total credit hours are required, 48 hours of coursework and 24 hours of dissertation research\n\n",
