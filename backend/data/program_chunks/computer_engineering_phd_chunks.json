Our joint program with the University of Alabama at Huntsville can prepare you for research careers in both industry and academia.\nTo give you the training you need for your specific goals, you will work with our graduate committee to design your curriculum and choose your research topic before you take your first class. Then, once you begin, your courses will cover topics like computer engineering, mathematics, theoretical or formal methods, electrical engineering, and other supportive fields. You'll take classes such as Wireless Communications, Medical Imaging Processing, Control Systems, Computer Architecture, Industrial Power Systems, and Information Theory and Coding. Finally, you'll complete a comprehensive exam, conduct and defend extensive dissertation research, and present your findings.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Arie Nakhmani\n[anry@uab.edu](mailto:anry@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://www.uab.edu/gradadmissions/online-application)\n# Ph.D. Program\n![\"\"](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/ece/images/photos/inline/graduate-programs.jpg)The Ph.D. in Computer Engineering program provides further opportunities for advanced study and research in Electrical and Computer Engineering-related fields.
