It is a professional graduate degree for both pre-career students and in-service administrators. The program is designed to develop the insights and skills needed to plan and formulate policy, and to organize, manage, and implement programs and operations. The MPA program is accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (\nNASPAA\n). Its Board of Advisors consists of internal and external stakeholders comprised of community members, alumni and students.\nThe MPA curriculum is designed to ensure that students achieve competency in five domains:\nto lead and manage in the public interest;\nto participate in, and contribute to, the policy process;\nto analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make evidence-informed decisions in a complex and dynamic environment;\nto articulate, apply, and advance a public service perspective;\nto communicate and interact productively and in culturally responsive ways with a diverse and changing workforce and society at large.\nMPA Program Mission\nThe UAB MPA Program is committed to excellence in graduate education through teaching, research, service, and practice. Through a knowledge- and skills-based curriculum informed by public values, the Program focuses on building the next generation of ethical, inclusive, and responsive decisionmakers who advance the public interest.\nDegree Requirements\nThe MPA degree requires a total of 39 semester hours. Students must maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA) as required by the UAB Graduate School and must remain in compliance with the MPA Program Grade Policy. Previous graduate work at UAB or another NASPAA-accredited MPA program may be credited toward the degree with approval of the Graduate Program Director. Students may select the thesis option or the non-thesis (portfolio) option.\nGrade Policies\nGraduate School Policy\nStudents must maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA) throughout the duration of the Program in accordance with Graduate School policies. If students fail to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 for any semester, they will receive a warning letter via email from the Graduate School. If the GPA remains below 3.0 for two (2) consecutive semesters, the student will receive a notification email from the Graduate School and be placed on academic probation. Students on probation must then make a 3.0 or better semester average for each succeeding semester that their overall cumulative average is below 3.0. Students are removed from probation when their cumulative average is 3.0 or above. If they make below a 3.0 average while on probation, they are dismissed. When students repeat a course, the last grade will be utilized to calculate their cumulative GPA.\nMPA Program Policy\nThe MPA program requires that students earn a grade of B or better in at least seven (7) of the eight (8) core MPA courses. Upon receiving the first grade of a C in any core course, a student will be notified by the program director and placed on probation in the program. A student who makes a second grade of C or below in any core course is subject to dismissal from the program, regardless of the overall GPA. After receiving a second C in a core course, a student must retake either of those two (2) courses, in accordance with\nGraduate School guidelines\n, and must do so the next semester. If the student earns a grade of B or better during the retaken course, they must file a\ngrade replacement application\nwith the Graduate School. If that application is approved, they will be allowed to continue their coursework and remain in the program. Please note: a grade of F given for academic misconduct is not eligible for replacement. This policy is also known as the “2-C Policy.”\nAdmission Requirements\nBecause of its multidisciplinary nature, persons from all undergraduate majors are considered for admission to the MPA program. The MPA program accepts applications for fall, spring, and summer admissions (international applications are accepted for fall and spring admission only). All applications must be made online by visiting the\nUAB Graduate School website\nApplications for the MPA program must include:\nUndergraduate transcripts (and, if applicable, graduate transcripts);\nStatement of interest that addresses this prompt:\nIn 1-2 single-spaced pages (300-600 words), please share why the MPA degree at UAB is right for you. Address your public service values and motivations, ways you want to make change, and vision for your career after obtaining your MPA degree. If you have prior academic deficiencies, please also address those in this statement; and\nTwo (2) letters of recommendation that meet the below criteria:\nIf possible, both letters should come from academic references (which may include professors and faculty advisors) and account for your academic performance and commitment. If one or both letters are not from academic references, they must be professional references. These letters must come from someone who was in a supervisory position in which you were their subordinate in either a work or volunteer capacity. They need to list in what capacity they know you (employee, subordinate, volunteer, etc.). Letters from peers, co-workers, friends, etc. are not acceptable.\nAn ideal candidate for the MPA program has an undergraduate and/or graduate GPA of around 3.0, strong letters of reference, and a statement of interest that strongly reflects a desire to serve the public interest.\nGrad Additional Info\nDeadline for Entry Term(s):\nEach semester\nDeadline for All Application Materials to be in the Graduate School Office:\nFall: August 1, Spring: December 1; Summer: April 1\nNumber of Reference Letters Required:\nFinancial Aid\nThe Department of Political Science and Public Administration has a limited number of graduate assistantships awarded on a competitive basis, which can be awarded during any semester as vacancies occur. The Department has several scholarships that are awarded on a competitive basis each spring. Other financial resources are available through the Office of Student Financial Aid.\nInternships\nPre-service students are encouraged to complete MPA 698: Internship in Public Administration as one of their electives. A few paid opportunities do arise, although many internships are unpaid. Typical placements are in city and county government, planning departments, public health agencies, social service agencies, state government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. Internships should be in place no later than a month prior to the start of the semester, and an internship agreement between the student, the internship organization, and the program is required. Students interested in completing an internship should contact the MPA program as soon as possible.\nAccelerated Learning Opportunities\nEarly Acceptance Program\nThe MPA program participates in UAB's\nEarly Acceptance (EA) Program\n. The EA program is designed for academically superior high-school students and allows these students to be conditionally admitted into the MPA program at the same time they are admitted to an undergraduate program. EA students must maintain a 3.5 undergraduate GPA at UAB to gain admission to the MPA program. EA students are required to take PSC 101: Foundations of American Government and recommended to take PSC 310: American Public Policy and PSC 323: Public Administration and Policy.\nAccelerated Bachelor's/Master's (ABM) Program\nThe MPA program participates in UAB's\nAccelerated Bachelor's/Master's (ABM) Program\n.
