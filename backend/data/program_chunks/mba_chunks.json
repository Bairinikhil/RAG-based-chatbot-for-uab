The program stresses critical thinking and is decision oriented, focusing on key aspects of business administration.\nThe MBA program is suitable not only for students with baccalaureate degrees in business but also for those who have degrees in engineering, the sciences, or liberal arts.\nUAB’s MBA program offers an online MBA, and an on-campus program where students may take a combination of face-to-face and online classes. Students may choose to follow either a one or two-year-plan of study to guarantee graduation with a specified time-frame, or to pursue the degree at their own pace. Students have 5 years from term of entry to complete degree requirements.\nConcentrations are available in finance, management information systems, marketing, health services, business analytics and entrepreneurship. Dual Degree options available include MD/MBA, DMD/MBA, OD/MBA, MPH/MBA, MSHA/MBA, MSN/MBA, ASEM/MBA, and several additional Engineering/MBA programs. Applicants interested in these dual degree options are required to apply and be accepted to both degree programs.\nQuantitative Requirement\nApplicants should be quantitatively proficient with the ability to analyze and interpret numerical information.

Non-degree seeking students are limited to applying 12 hours credit earned in this status to a degree-seeking program, if admitted.
