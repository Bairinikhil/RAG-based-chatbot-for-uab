You can actually build an entire career around public health research with an MS, and we can give you the skills you need to do so.\nTo get those skills, however, you need a curriculum that will immerse you in research practices and education experiences unique to your desired field. For instance, if you have a background in medicine or health professions, our clinical and translational science concentration can help you develop the skills you need for clinical research. In the environmental health toxicology concentration, you'll study how to assess environmental stressors and the risks they pose to humans. Or, consider the applied epidemiology concentration, where you'll focus on blending epidemiological research methods with didactic coursework and publication experiences. Interested in pharmacoepidemiology, study designs, policy, and sources of bias? Great. Our pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research concentration is a great option for you. And finally, if you need to balance school with your busy work schedule, our outcomes research concentration is offered fully online and can train you to evaluate specific health-care treatments in a variety of settings.\n### Concentrations\n- Applied Epidemiology\n- Biostatistics\n- Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences\n- Outcomes Research\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n### Concentration Offered Online\nThis program delivers most or all of the content for one or more concentrations online with the potential\nof a few on-campus meetings.

Each degree program provides a broad overview of [foundational public health knowledge](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/foundational-knowledge), but the majority of coursework focuses on biostatistics, epidemiology, and other research methods common in public health (in addition to discipline-specific coursework for doctoral degrees). Students conduct mentored research as part of their degree requirements and prepare a thesis or dissertation. Students earning these degrees have the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to design, execute, and analyze public health research, helping to prepare them to continue in academic or other research-intensive settings.\n- [Master of Science in Public Health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based)\n- [Master of Science](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based)\n- [Doctor of Philosophy](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based)\n- The **MSPH** is an academic, research-oriented degree (in contrast to the [MPH](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/practice-based), which is geared toward practice). Individuals interested in pursuing further education often earn an MSPH to build the skills necessary to conduct independent research at the doctoral level. It is ideal for individuals who intend to remain in academic research settings.\nAll MSPH degree programs at UAB begin with a brief overview of the [profession and science of public health and factors related to human health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/foundational-knowledge). The majority of the coursework focuses on the application of biostatistics, epidemiology, and other research methods to public health issues; specific coursework varies by concentration. All MSPH students engage in mentored research resulting in the development and presentation of a Master’s thesis or project, which may take the form of a publishable scientific manuscript.\nFollowing completion of the MSPH degree, many individuals continue working in academic research settings as research assistants/associates, analysts, program coordinators, etc. Career paths outside academia include epidemiologists with health departments, research analysts with managed care organizations, coordinators of clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry, and data analysts in a wide range of settings.\n- The **MS degree** in the UAB School of Public Health is offered through the Department of Biostatistics. This rigorous, research-based degree requires strong preparation in mathematics, including three semesters of calculus and a course in linear algebra. Students in the MS program are exposed to both theory and application in biostatistics, as well as advanced statistical computing. Students sit for a two-part qualifying examination covering both theory and applied statistics; they also complete a mentored research project which must be presented both orally to the Department and in writing.\nSome students pursue additional training in a Biostatistics doctoral program following completion of the MS degree, while others begin careers as research-oriented scientists performing high-level data management and statistical analysis in academic, governmental, or industry settings.\n- The UAB School of Public Health offers the **PhD** in a range of disciplines to help prepare students for high-level careers in academia, government, and industry. For students without a public health background, all degree program begins with a brief overview of the [profession and science of public health and factors related to human health](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/foundational-knowledge). Students take advanced coursework in their chosen discipline, along with additional training in research methods. Students also sit for comprehensive exams to demonstrate their mastery of the discipline. The culmination of the degree is the preparation and defense of a dissertation reflecting independent research of publishable quality.\n## Degrees Offered\n- [All](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based#)\n- [MSPH](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based#)\n- [MS](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based#)\n- [PhD](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/research-based#)\n[MSPH: Concentration in Applied Epidemiology](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-applied-epidemiology \"MSPH: Concentration in Applied Epidemiology\")\n### MSPH: Concentration in Applied Epidemiology\nIn-Class\n[MSPH: Concentration in Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-biostatistics \"MSPH: Concentration in Biostatistics\")\n### MSPH: Concentration in Biostatistics\nIn-Class\n[MSPH: Concentration in Environmental & Occupational Health Science](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-eohs \"MSPH: Concentration in Environmental & Occupational Health Science\")\n### MSPH: Concentration in Environmental & Occupational Health Science\nIn-Class\n[MSPH: Concentration in Industrial Hygiene](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-industrial-hygiene \"MSPH: Concentration in Industrial Hygiene\")\n### MSPH: Concentration in Industrial Hygiene\nIn-Class\n[MSPH: Concentration in Outcomes Research](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-outcomes-research \"MSPH: Concentration in Outcomes Research\")\n### MSPH: Concentration in Outcomes Research\nOnline\n[MD/MSPH: Public Health/Medicine](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/msph-md \"MD/MSPH: Public Health/Medicine\")\n### MD/MSPH: Public Health/Medicine\nIn-Class\n[MS: Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/ms-biostatistics \"MS: Biostatistics\")\n### MS: Biostatistics\nIn-Class\n[PhD: Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/phd-biostatistics \"PhD: Biostatistics\")\n### PhD: Biostatistics\nIn-Class\n[PhD: Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/phd-ehs \"PhD: Environmental Health Sciences\")\n### PhD: Environmental Health Sciences\nIn-Class\n[PhD: Epidemiology](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/phd-epidemiology \"PhD: Epidemiology\")\n### PhD: Epidemiology\nIn-Class\n[PhD: Health Behavior](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/graduate/programs/phd-health-behavior \"PhD: Health Behavior\")\n### PhD: Health Behavior\nIn-Class\n## Professional Licensure and Certifications\nCertification in public health is a voluntary credential that can help to distinguish a public health professional from their peers in the public health sector. The Certified in Public Health (CPH) credential is administered by the National Board of Public Health Examiners ( [www.nbphe.org](http://www.nbphe.org/)). Specific licensure requirements vary from state to state, and among territories. Please visit the [Professional Licensure and Certification General Disclosures webpage](https://www.uab.edu/elearning/students/professional-licensure) for more information on state and territories requirements.\n\n",
