Simply put, you need your MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nWith a master’s degree, you’ll be able to learn advanced skills in electrical and engineering or continue on a path for entry into a doctoral program. You see, we specifically designed a curriculum for you to build on the foundation you established when you earned your bachelor's. As a graduate student, you'll delve deep into such topics as computer software and networking, control, microelectronics and embedded systems, signal and image processing, power systems, telecommunication, and more. You'll also have the option of completing a thesis. As a thesis student, you'll need nine hours of research, and you'll present an oral defense. If you choose not to go the thesis route, there'll be extra coursework involved as well as a graduate project.\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Arie Nakhmani\n[anry@uab.edu](mailto:anry@uab.edu)\n[Apply Now](https://www.uab.edu/gradadmissions/online-application)\n# Master's Program\n![\"\"](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/ece/images/photos/inline/chip.jpg)\nAdvance your career in one of today’s most dynamic engineering fields. Our Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MSECE) program combines core technical knowledge with practical, hands-on experience in AI, embedded systems, signal processing, and more. Choose from thesis or non-thesis tracks and complete your degree in as little as 1.5 years.\nThe MSECE program provides a strong applied emphasis on areas that are not typically covered in depth in other programs. These include:\n✔ Embedded systems and robotics (Internet of Things – IoT)\n✔ Data analytics (machine learning)\n✔ Signal and image processing\n✔ Software engineering\n✔ Hardware-aware machine learning and edge AI applications\n✔ Control and power systems\nExciting research areas and coursework are available to meet a variety of goals and interests. The choice of courses is very flexible, but here are examples of three specializations:\n| Data Analytics | Signal and Image Processing | Internet of Things and Embedded Systems |\n| EE568 Introduction to Large Language Models (LLM) | EE512 Practical Computer Vision | EE527 Industrial Control |\n| EE610 Technical Communication for Engineers | EE523 Digital Signal Processing | EE537 Introduction to Embedded Systems |\n| EE634 Introduction to Neural Networks | EE563 Medical Image Analysis | EE544 Real-Time Processes and Protocols |\n| EE642 Intelligent Systems | EE623 Computer Vision | EE567 Brain Machine Interface |\n| EE654 Mobile Computing | EE626 Digital Image Processing | EE610 Technical Communications for Engineers |\n| EE655 Cloud Computing | EE638 Neural Time Series Data Analysis | EE627 Wireless Communications |\n| EE656 Introduction to Big Data Analytics | EE643 Numerical Methods in Engineering | EE632 Introduction to Computer Networking |\n| EE658 Machine Learning in Engineering | EE660 Medical Signal Processing | EE639 Embedded Systems |\n| EE668 Large Language Models: Theory and Practice | EE698 Non-Thesis Research | EE667 Advanced Brain-Machine Interface |\nA list of MSECE courses is available on the [MSECE Graduate Catalog Page](https://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/courseindex/ee/)\n## Career Opportunities\nOur graduates thrive in high-impact roles across:\n- Software and Systems Engineering\n- Robotics and Automation\n- Smart Infrastructure and IoT\n- FinTech and Healthcare IT\n## Get Involved in Research\nCollaborate with the School of Medicine, Health Professions, or external industry partners on impactful projects, such as:\n- Seizure onset zone detection from intracranial EEG\n- Smart devices for monitoring vital signs\n- Tumor precision ablation with heat\n- Effects of protein aggregations on learning\n- Personalized education platforms with adaptive AI\n## How to Apply\nAdmission requirements for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering MSECE program are available in the [UAB Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.uab.edu/graduate/schoolofengineering/electricalandcomputer/#msecetext).\nLimited financial assistance may be available for well-qualified students admitted into the MSECE program.\n[Apply NowOpens an external link.](https://www.uab.edu/gradadmissions/online-application)\n## Questions?\nFor more information on the graduate program, contact Dr. Arie Nakhmani, director of the graduate program, at [anry@uab.edu](mailto:anry@uab.edu).\n[Apply Now](https://www.uab.edu/gradadmissions/online-application)\n\n",
