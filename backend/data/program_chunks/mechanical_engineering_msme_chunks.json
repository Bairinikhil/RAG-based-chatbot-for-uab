A master’s degree can help you learn advanced engineering methods and give you research opportunities.\nWe've developed a research-intensive curriculum, with unique hands-on experiences and mentorship from our faculty. As you earn your degree, you'll have the option of choosing a path with or without a thesis. With a thesis, you’ll take more mathematics courses, which can be beneficial if you want to pursue a doctoral degree. If you'd rather do a research or design project, you can do so with an emphasis in research/design or technology/engineering management. No matter what you choose, you will have an opportunity to explore a number of research areas.\n### Concentrations\n- Engineering Management Emphasis\n- Research Design\n## Delivery Methods\n### On-Campus\nThis program delivers most of its content via on-campus, in-person meetings.\n[## Program Director\nDr. Roy Koomullil\n[rkoomul@uab.edu](mailto:rkoomul@uab.edu)\n# Graduate\n# Graduate Program\n![Students at working in front of School of Engineering sign.](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/mme/images/images/graduate/students-at-MPAD.jpg)The Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at UAB offers a variety of opportunities to conduct cutting-edge research in the fields of mechanical engineering as well as in a variety of materials science interests, such as metals and alloys, polymers and composites, biomaterials and healthcare materials and devices, ceramics and glass, and nanomaterials for a wide array of applications.
